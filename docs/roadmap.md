# Roadmap

Sequenced hardest-unknown / highest-leverage first, per CLAUDE.md. Each
milestone's deliverable must be proven by an actual QEMU smoke test in
`/tests/qemu`, not just "it compiled."

## 1. Boot → "hello kernel" via serial — DONE (this change)
**Proves:** toolchain + boot chain (cross-compiler, NASM, GRUB2/Multiboot2,
higher-half long-mode transition) all actually work together.
**Deliverables:**
- `boot/linker.ld`, `boot/grub.cfg`
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/boot.asm`: Multiboot2 header, 32-bit entry, CPUID/
  long-mode checks, boot page tables, GDT64, transition to long mode,
  jump to higher-half `kernel_main`.
- `kernel/drivers/serial.c/.h`: polling 16550 UART driver (COM1).
- `kernel/kernel.c`: `kernel_main`, prints `[OK] hello kernel`, halts.
- `libk/io.h`: `inb`/`outb`/`io_wait`.
**Verification:** `make check-mb2` (grub-file), `tests/qemu/test_boot_serial.sh`
(boots headless, greps serial output for the marker).
**Design record:** `docs/adr/0001-boot-protocol-and-long-mode-entry.md`.
**Known limitation (accepted for this milestone only):** boot page tables
only map the low 8MiB of physical memory (2MiB pages, no 4KiB level) —
replaced by a real VMM in Milestone 4.

## 2. GDT + IDT + exception handlers — implemented, verification pending toolchain
**Proves:** visibility into faults — everything after this depends on being
able to see *why* something broke instead of triple-faulting silently.
**Deliverables:**
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/gdt.c/.h`, `gdt_flush.asm`: C-managed 3-entry flat
  GDT (null/kernel-code/kernel-data), replacing boot.asm's throwaway one.
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/idt.c/.h`: 256-entry IDT, vectors 0-31 (CPU
  exceptions) populated as 64-bit interrupt gates; 32+ left not-present
  until Milestone 5 (IRQs).
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/isr.asm`: one stub per exception vector (0-31),
  normalizing to a uniform trap-frame shape and handling the long-mode
  stack-alignment gotcha explicitly (see ADR 0002).
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/exceptions.c`, `trap_frame.h`: `isr_handler` dumps
  vector/name/error-code/CR2(on #PF)/all registers to serial, then halts
  (no recovery path exists yet — every exception is fatal).
- `libk/fmt.c/.h`: `u64_to_hex`, host-tested (`tests/host/test_fmt.c`).
- `kernel/kernel.c`: calls `gdt_init()`/`idt_init()`, then deliberately
  triggers `int3` as a self-test that the fault-dump path works end to end.
**Verification:** object/link-level checks done (NASM assembly, manual
disassembly of the alignment-handling sequence, host `ld` exercising
`boot/linker.ld`'s structure) — see ADR 0002 for exactly what was and
wasn't checked. `tests/qemu/test_idt_selftest.sh` (boots, asserts the
`#BP Breakpoint` dump at vector `0x3`) still needs the
`x86_64-elf-gcc`/`binutils` AUR build to finish before it can run.
**Design record:** `docs/adr/0002-gdt-idt-exception-handling.md`.
**Known limitation (accepted for this milestone only):** no TSS, no IST
stacks — a fault while the kernel stack itself is corrupt (e.g. stack
overflow) will double-fault onto the same bad stack rather than a
dedicated safe one. Revisit if/when that's actually observed, or
alongside the scheduler once interrupts can land on arbitrary thread
stacks.

## 3. Physical frame allocator
## 4. Paging/VMM + kernel heap
## 5. PIT/APIC timer + IRQ handling
## 6. Preemptive scheduler + context switch (single CPU)
## 7. Userspace: ring 3, syscalls, process model
## 8. Later: FS, drivers, SMP (sequence TBD from what's learned above)

Milestones 3–8 are intentionally left as one-line placeholders here — full
breakdown (deliverables/acceptance criteria/estimates/risks) gets written
up when that milestone actually starts, not in advance, to avoid designing
against assumptions Milestones 1–2 might overturn.
